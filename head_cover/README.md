- as there is no spring tightener like in the original (my broken cover has anyway missing it) I put a slimstrip of the self adhesive felt damper inside of the holder hole: ![3d_print_holder_hole.jpg](3d_print_holder_hole.jpg).
- you need to stick a strip of self adhesive aluminium foil on the back side to prevent interferences : ![3d_print_alu_foil.jpg](3d_print_alu_foil.jpg) :
